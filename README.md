Student Performance Dashboard – Power BI
Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides an interactive and data-driven analysis of student performance across six subjects (BCC1–BCC6).
The dataset consists of 100 students, each evaluated out of 100 marks per subject. The goal of this project is to identify key academic insights such as overall class performance, top and bottom performers, subject-wise averages, and performance trends.

The dashboard helps educators, analysts, and administrators quickly evaluate class outcomes, identify struggling students, and make data-driven academic decisions.

Insights Derived

The average class performance stands at 66.88% across all subjects.

Top performer: Aarav Reddy with 88% overall.

Subjects BCC3 and BCC5 show relatively lower averages, indicating potential areas for academic improvement.

The bottom 5 students fall below 53%, requiring targeted intervention.

A clear performance variation trend exists across roll numbers, suggesting diversity in academic consistency.

Future Enhancements

Add gender and department-wise performance analytics.

Integrate student attendance and participation data for correlation analysis.

Build a machine learning model in Python to predict student success probability based on historical scores.
